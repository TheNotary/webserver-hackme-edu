# Text Correct

A rails app that renders assets to a browser client which can then use some backend service to correct text.  


# Dependencies

In an effort to presever the senetive information the dependency of period_opinionator is not available on github.  Email me and I'll send you the zip.  Check the bottom of Text Correct's Gemfile and ensure that period_opinionator has been deployed to the correct place.
